# Apprehensions

Some people may have apprehensions to these convention, such as:

#### "But dashes suck"

You're free to omit it and just use regular words, but keep the rest of the ideas in place (components, elements, variants).

#### "But I can't think of 2 words!"

Some components will only need one word to express their purpose, such as `alert`. In these cases, consider that using some suffixes will make it clearer that it's a block-level element:

  * `.alert-box`
  * `.alert-card`
  * `.alert-block`

  Or for inlines:

  * `.link-button`
  * `.link-span`
