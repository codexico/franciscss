A component can have another components inside.

Don't be afraid of building components that uses many other components.

## Naming components
Components can be named with **one or more words**, separated by an underscore.

Examples of a component:

  * A generic button (`.button`)
  * A form (`.form`)
  * A product feature (`.product_feature`)
  * A breadcrumb (`.breadcrumb`)
  * A section name (`.section_name`)
  * A menu hamburger (`.aside_menu`) _in this case the hamburger is just a component inside the menu_
