A component can have another components inside.

Don't be afraid of building components that uses many other components.

## Naming components
Components can be named with **one or more words**, separated by an __underscore__.

Examples of a component:

  * A generic button (`.button`)
  * A form (`.form`)
  * A product feature (`.product_feature`)
  * A breadcrumb (`.breadcrumb`)
  * A section name (`.section_name`)
  * A menu hamburger (`.aside_menu`) _in this case the hamburger is just a
   component inside the menu_

> Why underscores? The other frameworks use dashes!

> It's easier to edit, with one "Alt + →" you select the full component.

> Select a `.compound-name` and a `.compound_name` to see the difference.

>> Smart people sometimes don't think about the small things.

Components are the main classes in the css, it should be the easiest to write
 and edit.
